# Zuber Ride-Sharing Data Analysis

## Project Objective:
Analyze data for a ride-sharing company, Zuber, in Chicago to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors (e.g., weather) on ride frequency.

## Data Source:
- Competitor ride data, weather data

## Key Insights:
- Identified significant patterns between weather changes (such as rain and snow) and the increase/decrease in ride demand.
- Recommendations were made to adjust ride availability during peak times to increase revenue.

## Technology Stack:
- **Tools Used**: SQL, Excel, Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

## Analysis Workflow:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing entries and merged competitor and weather datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Examined how external factors like weather influence ride frequency and passenger preferences.
3. **Visualizations**: Generated heatmaps, bar charts, and line graphs to illustrate the relationship between ride demand and weather.

## Conclusion:
Weather patterns have a notable impact on ride demand. In rainy or snowy conditions, ride requests increased by 15%, presenting an opportunity for Zuber to increase driver availability during these times.

## Future Improvements:
- Expand analysis to explore additional factors such as traffic patterns and time of day.
- Implement machine learning models to predict ride demand based on weather forecasts.
